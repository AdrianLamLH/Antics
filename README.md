## Project Pitch
Imagine creating your own world—just with your fingertips. Inspired by Conway's Game of Life, we set out to build something that sparks imagination beyond the 2D screen, yet remains small and intuitive enough to fit in the palm of your hand. We're developing groundbreaking technology: a sandbox, free-to-roam game where AI-powered characters come to life through your drawings. Simply trace them with your finger, and watch as they talk, interact, and build stories together—shaped entirely by your imagination.

## Technology Stack
- Next.js for frontend framework
- React Three Fiber for 3D rendering
- Rapier physics engine for realistic character movement
- Three.js for 3D environment creation

## Features
- Interactive 3D environment
- Character creation through drawing
- Physics-based character movement
- AI-powered character interactions
- Customizable world elements

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Current Status
The project is in early development. We have successfully implemented:
- Basic 3D environment rendering
- Character physics and movement
- Character position tracking
- Auto-reset mechanism for characters falling out of bounds

## Next Steps
- Implement drawing-to-character conversion
- Add AI interaction between characters
- Develop world-building tools
- Enhance physics interactions
- Create user interface for world customization
